At first, the number of concepts that need to be explored can be overwhelming, but creating modern, easy-to-maintain software requires it.
On other hand Hexancore hides some complications behind abstractions and provides utility modules for common software problems like auth, persistance layer,  deploys and other.

Before start work with framework you need some basic knowledge about:
- Clean Architecture
- Onion Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Modular Monolithic Architecture
- Microservices Architecture
- Monorepo repository
- Domain-Driven Design(DDD)
- Command-query Separation(CQRS)

Hexancore utilize **NestJS** and **VueJS**, knowledge in that frameworks is a key to efficient works with this.
